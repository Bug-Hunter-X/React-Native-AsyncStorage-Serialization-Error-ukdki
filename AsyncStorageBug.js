This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native, particularly when dealing with large amounts of data or complex objects.  The error message itself might vary slightly, but it essentially indicates that AsyncStorage is having trouble serializing or deserializing the data you are trying to store or retrieve.  This can be caused by attempting to store objects or arrays that contain circular references (where an object refers back to itself, directly or indirectly) or functions, which AsyncStorage cannot handle.
