This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using AsyncStorage in React Native: serialization issues with large or complex data structures.  The `AsyncStorageBug.js` file shows the problem, while `AsyncStorageBugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation.  The error typically arises from attempting to store objects containing circular references or functions. The solution involves properly structuring data before storage, ensuring no circular references exist and converting functions into serializable data, if necessary.  See the code comments for details.
